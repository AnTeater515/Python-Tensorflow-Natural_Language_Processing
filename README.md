######Components

1- intents.json — abunch of JavaScript objects that lists different tags that correspond to different types of word patterns

2. train_chatbot.py — the code for reading in the natural language data into a training set and using a Keras sequential neural network to create a model

3. words.pkl — a list of different words that could be used for pattern recognition

4. classes.pkl — a list of different types of classes of responses

5- chatbot_model.h5 — the actual model created by train_chatbot.py and used by chatgui.py

6. chatgui.py — the code for cleaning up the responses based on the predictions from the model and creating a graphical interface for interacting with the chatbot

####How to Run
terminal: 'python chatgui.py'

####Dependancies
ChatterBot (pip install chatterbot)
tensorflow (pip install tensorflow)
keras (pip install keras)
pickle (pip install pickle)
nltk (pip install nltk)
